AVAILABLE EXERCISES BY MUSCLE GROUP:
${exerciseList}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Exercise names MUST match EXACTLY as listed above (e.g., "Bench Press" NOT "Barbell Bench Press")
2. weekday values: 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, 6=Saturday
3. ALWAYS start the workout week from Sunday (weekday 0). The first workout day should be Sunday, then continue through the week.
4. ONLY include workout days that the user requests - DO NOT add rest days
5. If user asks for 6-day workout, return exactly 6 workout days with exercises
6. If user asks for 3-day workout, return exactly 3 workout days with exercises
7. Every day MUST have at least 3-5 exercises

PROGRAM DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Compound movements first (squats, deadlifts, bench, rows, overhead press)
- Isolation exercises after compounds
- 48-72 hours between training same muscle group
- Balance push/pull ratios to prevent imbalances
- Include both horizontal and vertical push/pull movements

VOLUME GUIDELINES BY GOAL:
• Strength: 3-5 sets × 3-6 reps, compound-focused, longer rest
• Hypertrophy: 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps, mix of compound and isolation
• Endurance: 2-3 sets × 15-20 reps, shorter rest periods
• Beginner: 2-3 sets × 10-12 reps, full body 3x/week
• Intermediate: 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps, upper/lower or PPL split
• Advanced: 4-5 sets × 6-12 reps, specialized splits

SPLIT RECOMMENDATIONS:
- 2-3 days: Full Body each session
- 4 days: Upper/Lower split (2 upper, 2 lower)
- 5-6 days: Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) or Arnold split

EXERCISE ORDER (per session):
1. Power/Olympic lifts (if applicable)
2. Main compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift variations)
3. Secondary compounds (rows, presses, lunges)
4. Isolation exercises (curls, extensions, raises)
5. Core/abs work (optional, at end)

Create a balanced, effective program that matches the user's goals, experience, and available training days.`;
